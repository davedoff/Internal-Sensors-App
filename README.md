# Internal-Sensors

This Android application measures and displays the current angle of the device using the internal gyroscope sensor and accelerometer. The app leverages the GraphView API to graph the measurements taken over a set time period, and the data is saved to a JSON file. The app is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing a well-organized structure for the codebase.
